            Good communication is the key to working effectively in any team. Here's how I communicate with my team and other engineers at Sainsbury's and what works best for me as an associate engineer.

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Teams/Slack</span></h2>
        <p>
            My team primarily uses <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> for our daily stand-ups, ceremonies, and general updates from product manager and line manager to the whole team. I use Teams for things like checking in with colleagues, sharing progress, or if some team members prefer to communicate via Teams over Slack<br><br>

            Most of the time however, my team and I use <strong>Slack</strong> to communicate quickly amongst ourselves or with other teams. Both platforms make it easy to collaborate, share files, and keep everyone in the loop. For me, instant messaging is ideal when I need to clarify something quickly or have an ongoing, informal conversation, hence why I prefer to use Slack.

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Email</span></h2>
        <p>
            I use <strong>Emails</strong> for more formal communication, like sending out important information, arranging meetings, or if I need to keep a clear record (paper trail) of what's been discussed. If the topic is sensitive or needs to be communicated to multiple stakeholders, email is my go-to platform. I always try to keep emails clear and to the point, to respect everyone's time as I would want others to respect mine.

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Video Call</span></h2>
        <p>
            When a topic is complex or needs detailed discussion, my team and I would set up a <strong>video call</strong> on Teams (sometimes can be on Slack too). This is the best option for anything that would be confusing over chat, or when I want to share my screen and walk someone through an issue or new feature.<br><br>

            I find video calls are also great for daily stand-ups, team retros, pair programming, or when I want to have a more “human” conversation that builds team bonding.

        <h2><span class="stage-title">Face-to-Face</span></h2>
        <p>
            Whenever I'm in the office, I try to connect with my teammates face-to-face. In-person meetings seem perfect for building relationships with colleagues. When me and my team are in the office together, apart from talking and catching up, we also like to have lunch and drinks together. This helps us bond as a team and build a positive working environment.
