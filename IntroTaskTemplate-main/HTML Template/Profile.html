            Here's a little more about me, my background, and how I work best as a developer. If you want to know what it's like working with me, or you're just curious about my journey so far, this is the place to be!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey again! I'm <strong>Book Seenonmuang</strong> (Thai name Phanuwat), currently an Associate Engineer (C3) at Sainsbury's and working towards my Level 4 Software Development apprenticeship with Just IT and aspiring to become a C4 software engineer here at Sainsbury's.  
            <br><br>
            I was born in Bangkok Thailand, and moved to London at 7 years old. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through software and working as part of a collaborative, forward-thinking team.  
            <br><br>
            My main focus right now is sharpening my skills in JavaScript, React, Next.js and eventually move onto back-end technologies like GoLang, Node.js and AWS, while learning as much as I can about modern software practices in a commercial setting.

        <h2>Ways I Prefer to Communicate</h2>
        <p>
            I value open and straightforward communication (very important to avoid unnecessary confusion in the work place). Here's what works best for me:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> book.seenonmuang@sainsburys.co.uk (for anything formal, important, or if you need a paper trail)</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Messaging:</strong> Slack or Microsoft Teams (preferably Slack) (best for quick questions, team chat, and day-to-day updates)</li>
            <li><strong>Video Calls:</strong> Teams (for collaborative work, problem-solving sessions, or anything that needs a bit more back-and-forth)</li>
            <li><strong>In-person:</strong> Always up for face-to-face also if we're in the office, great for brainstorming or general team-building!</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="working-with-me">
        <h2>How to Work with Me</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to get the best out of working with me, here are a few things I appreciate:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be clear and direct. Context is everything!</li>
            <li>I love constructive feedback, especially if it helps me improve or learn something new.</li>
            <li>Respect deadlines, but if anything changes, I would like to know early on.</li>
            <li>I'm always open to collaborating and sharing ideas. Don't be afraid to pair up with me, I love bouncing ideas off others.</li>
            <li>Keeping things positive and honest; it helps the team and makes work more enjoyable.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="past-experience">
        <h2>Past Experience and CPD (Continuing Professional Development)</h2>
        <p>
            My journey into tech started after finishing university at Brunel, where I became interested in game development. From here, I would find out about software development through the Just IT Level 3 Software Development Bootcamp and ended up here at Sainsbury's as an associate engineer. Previously, I've worked in customer service, hospitality, and food service, and these roles taught me a lot about teamwork and communication.  
            <br><br>
            In 2024, as mentioned in the above, I joined the Just IT Software Development Bootcamp, where I built projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learned database basics (MySQL), and created a personal portfolio site. Now at Sainsbury's, I'm learning Git and React so far, and working with my team in an agile way of working.  
            <br><br>
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Previous Roles:</strong> Waiter and bartender at a Thai restaurant called "Imm Thai Fusion". Here I also handled their website and social media content creation such as promotions and offers. Also made a website for a start-up Thai massage business called "Even Thai Spa".</li>
                <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Portfolio website, menu design for Imm Thai Fusion, website for a Thai massage company, food promotion campaigns, UI improvements on Sainsbury's booking a slot page.</li>
                <li><strong>Training:</strong> Codecademy (JavaScript, Git, GitHub), Just IT bootcamp, self-study with FreeCodeCamp, YouTube etc.</li>
            </ul>
